# ChatBot
A java program incorporating RESTful Web services that creates a chat bot for a server channel. This bot displays information about the weather in a given city as well as new Spotify releases. The program pulls in and parses JSON-formatted information from an OpenWeatherMap API corresponding to the city as well as from a Client-Credential Spotify API endpoint for new releases and returns the information through the chat bot to the server channel.

# How to Connect
Navigate to https://webchat.freenode.net/ and connect to the server that the bot will connect to (#demobot by default).

In order to use the Spotify New Releases command, the user must input their personal Spotify Client_ID and Client_Secret in the postRequest() function found in SpotifyAPI.java. Client identification can be found on https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login

# Commands

!version   - Displays the version number and date

disconnect - Disconnects the bot from the server.

Say hi to the bot! It will greet you back.
